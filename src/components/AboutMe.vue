    <h1 class="title">A bit about Me</h1>
    <p>
        It all started way back in 2016 where I created my very first javascript application. 
        And here I am now, providing the best quality products for the people I'm working for.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've worked with different types of projects like <span>Information System</span>, <span>E-Commerce Widgets</span>,
        <span>CMS Applications</span>, and <span>Customer-Facing Websites</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from my passion with coding, I also do like writing poems.
