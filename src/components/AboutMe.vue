        <p>
            It all started way back in 2016 where I created my very first javascript application. 
            And here I am now, providing the best quality products for the people I'm working for.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked with different types of projects like <span>Information System</span>, <span>E-Commerce Widgets</span>,
            <span>CMS Applications</span>, and <span>Customer-Facing Websites</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from my passion with coding, I also do like writing poems.
